% Detail what the minimum desirable outcome is and how success will be measured.

\section{Scope of the project and Key Performance Indicators}

The minimum desirable outcome for this project was to build an end-to-end machine learning solution able to produce content-to-content
similarity recommendations using Passport metadata tags as input. On a qualitative level, success meant producing recommendations
comparable with the ones currently in production. This was initially tested by visualising and manually comparing the similarities and differences
of the two result sets. A panel of stakeholders with diverse domain knowledge was involved to give their subjective feedback.

The usage of Passport tags was a success/failure boolean measure, while the coverage and spread of the metadata among the
top K recommended items with respect to the seed item was used as a quantitative measure of diversity.
