\section{Outline of the issue or opportunity and the business problem to be solved}

The BBC produces and stores vast amounts of data for its content, surfaced by countless services and APIs.
One of the top priorities for the BBC is to increase the usage across the business of \textbf{Passport} \cite{BBC:PassportMetadata},
an internal BBC system that provides a richer set of metadata annotations for multimodal content (audio, video and text).
The usage in production is low, and its BBC-wide adoption would make access to metadata consistent, remove duplications, and reduce effort and costs.

Furthermore, the similarity score of the current C2C recommender is directly proportional to the number of values in common between any pairs of items
on a per-feature basis. However, the commonality is calculated with exact string equality, ignoring any relationship between different
categorical values expressing a similar concept (e.g. ``comedy'' and ``stand-up comedy'').

Moreover, the limited number and type of tags cannot adequately describe the content.
At the same time, the skewedness of the data distribution and a lack of pre-processing, shifts the recommendations towards the most popular categories.

Lastly, each similarity score is multiplied by a hardcoded weight that modulates the importance of a feature, but it doesn't solve
the polarising effect of a skewed distribution. Unfortunately, because these are hyperparameters and not learned weights, the model can't improve
its performances by minimising them against a cost function.

To address these issues, the aim of this project was:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{To improve the quality of the C2C similarity recommendations}.
  By using in input a richer set of metadata that better describes the content, and by reducing the high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional latent manifold,
  the model would be able to generate embeddings that could improve the quality of the recommendations, by mapping the item similarity problem to a geometric
  distance calculation between vectors in a multidimensional Euclidean space.
  \item \textbf{To build a general solution that can be applied to multimodal content, reducing the costs}. I built a C2C recommender for iPlayer,
  using the Passport dataset to make the solution general so that it could be applied to any BBC content,
  which shares the same set of standard tags.
  \item \textbf{To build a foundational item-embeddings generator}. Content-based recommenders use item metadata.
  This project provided an immediate solution for non-personalised C2C recommendations that solely rely on them.
  It also provided a foundational basis for personalised recommenders that could benefit from using content metadata embeddings
  combined with other data like user interactions.
\end{itemize}
