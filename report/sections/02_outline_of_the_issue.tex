\section{Outline of the issue, opportunity and the business problem to be solved}

The BBC produces and stores vast amounts of data for its content, surfaced by countless services and APIs.
One of the top priorities for the BBC is to increase the usage across the business of \textbf{Passport} \cite{BBC:PassportMetadata},
an internal BBC system that provides a rich set of metadata annotations for multimodal content (audio, video and text).
The usage in production is low, and its BBC-wide adoption would make access to metadata consistent, remove duplications, and reduce effort and costs.

In addition, the current content similarity calculation uses a suboptimal approach, which limits the quality of the recommendations.
The similarity score is directly proportional to the number of values in common between any pairs of items
on a per-feature basis. However, the commonality is calculated with exact string equality,
ignoring any relationship between different categorical values expressing a similar concept (e.g. ``comedy'' and ``stand-up comedy'').
Moreover, the limited number and type of tags cannot adequately describe the content.
At the same time, the skewness of the data distribution and a lack of pre-processing bias the recommendations towards the high-frequency values.
Lastly, each similarity score is multiplied by a hardcoded weight that modulates the importance of a feature,
but it does not solve the polarising effect of a skewed distribution.
Unfortunately, because these are hyperparameters and not learned weights,
the model cannot improve the performance by minimising them against a cost function.

This project could help the BBC enhance the quality of recommendations while reducing costs and accelerating innovation,
thus increasing the licence fee value for money. Its contribution could:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Improve the quality of the content similarity recommendations}.
  This solution ingested a rich set of metadata that better described the content and applied a novel technique
  that improved the descriptive power of the transformed metadata, improving the similarity calculation quality.
  \item \textbf{Build a foundational item-embeddings generator for upstream recommenders}.
  This project provided an immediate solution for non-personalised C2C recommendations that solely rely on content metadata.
  It also provided a foundational approach for embedding generation for upstream personalised recommenders,
  which could improve the quality of the personalised recommendation and increase user engagement.
  \item \textbf{Reduce costs by building a general solution for the wider BBC}.
  The pipeline ingested a dataset of content metadata composed of tags used to annotate all BBC content,
  making this solution general and reducing duplications and costs.
\end{itemize}
