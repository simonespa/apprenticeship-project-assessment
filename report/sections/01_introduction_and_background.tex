\section{Introduction and background}

I am a software engineer at the BBC and team lead for the Sounds web team.
I also trained as a data scientist and worked in attachment to the iPlayer Recommendation team.

I built a machine learning model pipeline that generates content-to-content (C2C) similarity recommendations
of video-on-demand (VOD) for the ``More Like This'' section on BBC iPlayer\cite{BBC:MoreLikeBluey}.
This project is relevant to me because I have been crossing paths with the world of recommendations multiple times
during my career at the BBC, which sparked my interest.
I had a tangent encounter in 2015 while working for a team that built
an initial recommender for BBC News and an API to provide recommendations using third-party engines.
I also produced and presented a talk for a Hack Day.
The talk was called ``Recommendation Assumptions'' \cite{RecsAssumptions},
and it was about types of recommendations and contextual external factors affecting them.
Until now, when I could finally put my knowledge into practice working on an actual project on real data.

The BBC is a well-known British broadcaster that is constantly evolving to remain relevant to its audience.
Its mission is to inform, educate, and entertain, and it operates within the boundaries set by the Royal Charter \cite{BBC:RoyalCharter}.
The current media landscape requires the BBC to deliver digital-first content relevant to the audience.
This transformation involves investments in data and personalised services,
not to mention an inevitable revolution in generative machine learning modelling that is keeping everyone busy.
