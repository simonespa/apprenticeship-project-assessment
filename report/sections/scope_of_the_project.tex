% Detail what the minimum desirable outcome is and how success will be measured.
% Data selection, collection & pre-processing
% This gives a good opportunity to briefly describe the data architecture of your company
% You must show you have considered all relevant data protection policies and regulations (both internal company policy and external laws or guidelines).
% If you use any data external to the company you must reference it.
% Justify the choice of the data and why it is relevant to the project
% State what tools you used to efficiently gather the data
% Outline briefly the data cleansing steps you have taken and the consideration of any source of error and bias
% Survey of potential alternatives
% Best practice in any data science problem is to consider a range of appropriate models
% Detail the alternative models
% State the pros and cons of each, including the justification for your chosen approach.
% Critical evaluation of your methods is key
% Implementation - performance metrics
% The efficacy of your chosen model will be one of the main factors behind choosing it as your approach and dismissing alternatives.
% This can be demonstrated by showing a range of performance metrics for the model you have chosen as well as for the alternatives considered
% Justify your choice of metrics stating why they are appropriate for this particular implementation of machine learning
% It may be easiest to present these metrics and methods in a tabular format
